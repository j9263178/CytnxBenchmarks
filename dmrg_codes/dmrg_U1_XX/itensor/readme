Run
`make`
to compile the ITensor DMRG code

This is for XX model for L=100 sites

In the input file, you can specify
1. Use quantum number or not
2. The bond dimension you target

Run the code by:
./dmrg input > out

Note that if the actual bond dimension is smaller than the target one, there would be error message starting with
"dim not match:"
You need to check this does not happend

Run the Python file
`python readtensor.py out`
to extract the matrix elements
